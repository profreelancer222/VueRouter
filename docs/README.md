- Nested route/view mapping
- Modular, component-based router configuration
- Route params, query, wildcards
- View transition effects powered by Vue.js' transition system
- Fine-grained navigation control
- Links with automatic active CSS classes
- HTML5 history mode or hash mode, with auto-fallback in IE9
- Customizable Scroll Behavior

[Get started](./guide/) or play with the [examples](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/tree/dev/examples) (see [`README.md`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/) to run them).
